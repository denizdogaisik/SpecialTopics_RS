# Change in Istanbul Airport Region
- In the scope of the project, the change in the Istanbul Airport region was examined. This project was designed to monitor the change that started with the images taken from the dates long before the construction of Istanbul Airport and to reveal the differences around the construction of the airport and during this process. Change can be seen as a GIF year by year, also the difference can be seen seperately in the final step.

## Project Creation 
- The "Change in Istanbul Airport Region" project was created by using Git, GitHub, and Google Earth Engine. 
- Test images were obtained online from the Google Earth Engine.
- Signing in Google account is required to monitor output images.
- Landsat RGB images are used to determine change in region from 1985, and to create timelaps animations. 
- The GIF of change of the area can be seen on the map.
- The split method was used to make dual comparison of images taken from different years (1998-2019).
- The final comparison can be seen by using change button.

### Source Code
- 18_create_landsat_timelapse.ipynb source code was learned from [GEE Tutorial #18 - Creating Landsat timelapse animations with animated text using Earth Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwjSJnGWKJs&list=PLAxJ4-o7ZoPccOFv1dCwvGI6TYnirRTg3&index=19&ab_channel=QiushengWu) youtube video.
